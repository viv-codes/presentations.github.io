						<h1>What is Kubernetes?</h1>
					</section>
                    <section>
						<p>Kubernetes, or k8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.</p>
                    </section>
					<section>
						<p>K8s' main focus is scaling, both on a service-level and on a platform-level basis. A k8s cluster can be run on a raspberry pi, across several VMs, or on an entire datacenter. There are also cloud-based options of hosting k8s, such as Google Kubernetes Engine</p>

						<h1>Control Plane Components</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>What is a control plane?</h3>
						<img src="k8sassets/Kubernetes-Control-Plane-Chart.png" alt="Control Plane">
						<aside class="notes">
							A control plane is the container orchestration layer, where the management of the cluster occurs. Typically, this is on a separate machine or VM, and user containers are not run on the control plane. For example, when you interface with a cluster via `kubectl`, you are making HTTP requests to the API server.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>kube-apiserver</h3>
						<img src="k8sassets/kube-api.png" alt="kube-apiserver">
						<aside class="notes">
							The API server is the frontend for the k8s control plane, and is what is used to interface with the rest of the cluster. It is responsible for managing the cluster, and is responsible for handling requests from users.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>etcd</h3>
						<img src="k8sassets/etcd.svg" alt="etcd">
						<aside class="notes">
							etcd is a distributed key-value store, and is used to store the cluster's state and configuration information.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>kube-scheduler</h3>
						<img src="k8sassets/kube-scheduler.png" alt="kube-scheduler">
						<aside class="notes">
							The scheduler is responsible for assigning pods to nodes. It is also responsible for managing the cluster's load balancing. The scheduler takes into account resource requirements, policy contraints, data locality, and deadlines. 
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>kube-controller-manager</h3>
						<img src="k8sassets/kube-controller-manager.png" alt="kube-controller-manager">
						<aside class="notes">
							The controller manager is responsible for managing the cluster's state and configuration. It is responsible for managing the cluster's services, pods, and other resources. There are several types of controllers, including node controllers, job controllers, endpoint controllers, and service account & token controllers. 
						</aside>

						<h1>Node Components</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>What is a node?</h3>
						<img src="k8sassets/k8s-node.png" alt="Node">
						<aside class="notes">
							A node is a server or VM that is part of a k8s cluster. Nodes are the underlying hardware that pods are run on, and are controlled by the control plane. 
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>kubelet</h3>
						<img src="k8sassets/kube-controller-manager.png" alt="kube-controller-manager">
						<aside class="notes">
							The kubelet is the agent that runs on each node and is responsible for managing the node's containers. The kubelet handles requests from the API server by responding to PodSpecs and ensuring that the containers described in those specs are running and healthy. 
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>kube-proxy</h3>
						<img src="k8sassets/kube-controller-manager.png" alt="kube-controller-manager">
						<aside class="notes">
							The kube-proxy maintains network rules on nodes, which coordinate communication between individual pods and the rest of the cluster. The kube-proxy can also be used to interface with your cluster from a computer that is not a part of the cluster by forwarding traffic.

						<h3>Namespaces</h3>

						<h3>Pods</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Deployments</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Services</h3>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					This is done by using a simple, declarative model for describing the desired state of the cluster.
					<pre><code data-trim data-noescape data-line-numbers>
						$ kubectl apply -f changes.yaml
					</code></pre>
					<aside class="notes">
						Instead of directly making changes via the command line, or on a web interface, changes are applied in the form of YAML files. This applies to every kind of change that you could make on a cluster. Deployments, access control, networking settings; any of these are changed via a YAML file.
